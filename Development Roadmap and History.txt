# ====================================================
# Purpose:  
# This roadmap outlines development tasks, enhancements, and historical decisions  
# across all scripts in Utilsrepo. It serves as a **structured, human-readable archive**  
# for tracking modifications and guiding future iterations.  
# ====================================================

## **Roadmap Structure**
This file organizes development progress into **past**, **current**, and **future** stages:
- **Completed Tasks:** Archive of implemented changes, including reasoning and impact.
- **Ongoing Work:** Active modifications requiring iteration or testing.
- **Planned Features:** Future enhancements and exploratory ideas.

---

## **Completed Tasks**
âœ… **PowerShell Profile Fixes** (`Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`)  
- Resolved module locking errors for multiple shell instances.  
- Ensured proper logging setup and execution without syntax failures.  

âœ… **AI Directives Strengthening** (`AI_Directives.txt`)  
- Enforced **full-file/script output** requirements.  
- Expanded Git, licensing, and automation directives for strict compliance.  

âœ… **Repository Organization Improvements**  
- Verified that all primary scripts are structured within `Utilsrepo`.  
- Identified that `SETUP.ps1` requires a complete initialization script.  

---

## **Ongoing Work**
ðŸ”„ **Refine Roadmap Structure (`ROADMAP.md`)**  
- Optimize formatting for clear readability.  
- Establish guidelines for documenting feature iterations effectively.  

ðŸ”„ **Ensure Git Commit Automation (`Git-QuickCommit`)**  
- Validate that **Git commits include roadmap updates** when changes are recorded.  
- Implement **automated commit triggers** where applicable.  

ðŸ”„ **Enhance Logging Across Scripts** (`DiskPerfTelemetry.ps1`, `PersistentAdminShell.ps1`)  
- Standardize structured logging outputs to ensure uniform debugging and tracking.  
- Ensure **SQLite-based logging** integration where beneficial.  

---

## **Planned Features**
ðŸš€ **Finalize `SETUP.ps1` for Environment Initialization**  
- Automate module installations and **PowerShell environment setup**.  
- Configure default execution settings for streamlined usability.  

ðŸš€ **Improve Telemetry Data Collection (`DiskPerfTelemetry.ps1`)**  
- Expand data capture beyond just **IOPS, latency, and throughput**.  
- Integrate **dynamic counter selection** for more robust analysis.  

ðŸš€ **Optimize Disk Management Scripts (`ListVolumesAndSetDisksOffline.ps1`)**  
- Enhance logic for **tiering automation** using telemetry results.  
- Implement **automated evacuation of slow drives** based on performance data.  

ðŸš€ **Strengthen Git Workflow (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`)**  
- Automate repository documentation updates when new development milestones are reached.  
- Ensure **consistent commit metadata** to maintain historical clarity.  

---
### **Final Note**
**This roadmap is a living document.** Updates should be reflected here **before committing** changes, ensuring transparent, structured tracking.  
ðŸ”„ **Modernize Legacy Scripts for Compliance**
- Review all uploaded PowerShell scripts for alignment with current directives.
- Add region headers, standard metadata, CLI params, and structured logging.
- Refactor monolithic disk scripts into modular, reusable components.

ðŸš€ **Rename and Replace Obsolete Copilot Scripts**
- Convert `Regenerate-CopilotHistory.ps1` to `Regenerate-ChatGPTHistory.ps1`
- Convert `Initialize-CopilotHistory.ps1` to ChatGPT-aligned naming and structure.
- Remove deprecated `Close-CopilotSession.ps1` in favor of new ChatGPT version.
